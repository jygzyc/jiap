//! Recovery of string building that the compiler spread over several statements.
//!
//! `a + b` compiles to a `StringBuilder` allocated into a local, appended to
//! once per term, and read back with `toString`. Read literally that is one
//! variable and one statement per term, none of which the author wrote, and it
//! hides the concatenation from the proof that would fold it back: that proof
//! matches a chain of calls, and a builder living in a local is not one.
//!
//! `append` answers with the builder it was called on, so the statements are
//! already a chain — the compiler merely spelled it out a call at a time.
//! Writing it back as one expression is therefore an identity, not a guess:
//! the terms keep their order, nothing moves across a foreign statement, and
//! the builder still ends up in the same variable. What the chain then enables
//! is left to the stages that already exist — scheduling carries a
//! single-use builder to its `toString`, and the concatenation proof folds the
//! result into `+`.
