//! Guarded-assignment recovery for self-selecting definitions.
//!
//! Gated-Phi recovery materializes a merge as one selection over the reaching
//! conditions of the join. Source-variable allocation then coalesces the inputs
//! of that merge into a single local, so every arm that carried an input the
//! destination already holds degenerates into a read of the destination itself.
//!
//! Such an arm stores the value that already reaches the statement, so the write
//! it describes is unobservable. Lowering the selection back to control flow,
//! with those arms as empty branches, recovers the regions the merge came from
//! instead of leaving each one to re-derive its predicate inside an expression.
